Project Structure
Here's an overview of the files and directories in this repository:

Bloc_2_Speed_Dating.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the analysis code. You can consult this notebook to dive into the details of the analysis process, explore the data, and understand the methodologies used.

data/: This directory contains the dataset used for the analysis. If you would like to reproduce the analysis or work with the dataset, you can find it here.

Getting Started
To replicate the analysis or further explore the code, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/serdarcekinmez/bloc_02_Speed_Dating.git
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You may need to set up a Python environment with the necessary libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) if you don't already have them.

Open the Bloc_2_Speed_Dating.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment. You can use Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or any other compatible tool of your choice.

Run the notebook cells to execute the analysis code and observe the results. Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different approaches.
